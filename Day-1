what is build and deployment ?
We need to know build and deplop which is very importamt.
BUILD :
- eg., many microservices are there in Netflix . developers will push to git . which is a RAW code or source code.
- Source code will be converted to product or application.
- deliverables or Artifcats.
- source code is like raw rice , not consumable or can't run this.
- so its needs to be converted to machine readable.
- Software build --> convert source code into artifacts.

Two steps in build:

1. compilation. ( program files to object files ( machine format ) ) Eg., java code .java into .class files
2. combine all object files to --> packaging / single deliverable / Artifacts

complier : source code --> object code --> deliverable --> execute eg., java , go , c and c++ - complier utility
Interpreter : source code --> intermediate code --> execute eg., py , node , js , ruby 
( not to convert into object code , only packaging ) , interpreter utility . No concept of compilation.

Difference :

complier language :
1. entire program
2. object files
3. execution happens after compilation
4. it runs faster
5. cpu will be higher
6. requires more memory

Interpreter language :

1. line by line
2. no additional files are created
3. execution takes place after every line.
4. runs slower
5. cpu is less
6. memory efficient
